I am trying to do my first python project on creating a program that let's a user to make an appointment
for a bus where the buses have their own routes. The route of the bus contains the routing number (which means
if the there are "n" number of buses then there are routing numbers starting from 1 to n),the departure address,
and one address that it is passing through, the arrival address and the distance from the departure to arrival. The 
bus contains plate number and driver's name. 

In this program users can appointSeat and the program contains a file that calculates a free seat and let the user to 
assign a seat(the assigned seat will not be available for another user). 

The other file allows the user to schedule a bus based on the data of the bus(plate number and driver's name(opt))and the 
route of the bus(routing number,departure,passing through and arriving address)
